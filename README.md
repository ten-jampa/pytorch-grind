# PyTorch Grind

This repository contains my deep dive into PyTorch, organized as a structured learning path through the fundamentals of deep learning with PyTorch.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main sections:

### PyTorch Documentation (`pytorch_documentation/`)
Contains hands-on implementations following the official PyTorch tutorials.

### PyTorch in 25 Hours (`pytorch_in_25_hours/`)
A structured learning path divided into modules.

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

2. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pytorch-grind.git
cd pytorch-grind
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Start with either:
   - `pytorch_documentation/quickstart_tutorial.ipynb` for a quick overview
   - `pytorch_in_25_hours/00-pytorch-fundamentals/pytorch-fundamentals.ipynb` for a structured learning path

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of basic linear algebra concepts
- Familiarity with deep learning concepts (helpful but not required)

## Technologies Used

- PyTorch - Deep learning framework
- torchvision - Computer vision utilities
- NumPy - Numerical computing
- Matplotlib - Data visualization
- Jupyter - Interactive computing

## Learning Path

This repository follows two parallel tracks:
1. **Documentation Track**: Working through official PyTorch tutorials to understand the framework's capabilities
2. **Structured Learning**: A 25-hour curriculum breaking down PyTorch concepts into digestible modules

Each notebook is self-contained with detailed explanations, code examples, and practical exercises to reinforce learning.
